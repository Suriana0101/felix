    <p>In February 2024, Felix of Stray Kids dedicated his Lunar New Year holiday to volunteering with <b>UNICEF in Laos</b>, focusing on improving children’s health and well-being. He visited the Atapu region, where he assisted in nutritional assessments and promoted hygiene education among local communities. Felix’s efforts included interacting with children and supporting initiatives aimed at combating malnutrition and poor sanitation. His hands-on involvement demonstrated a deep commitment to humanitarian causes beyond his musical career. Prior to his trip, <i>Felix donated 100 million South Korean Won (approximately $76,500 USD) to UNICEF</i>, becoming <b>the youngest member of the UNICEF Honors Club</b>. This generous contribution supported nutrition and water sanitation programs for children in Laos. During his visit, Felix met with families and participated in community health outreach activities, witnessing firsthand the challenges faced by children in the region. His experiences were documented in a series titled <i>“UNICEF Login Laos-Stray Kids Felix,”</i> released on UNICEF’s official YouTube channel. Felix expressed that the trip allowed him to understand the realities faced by Laotian children, emphasizing that all children deserve the opportunity to live healthy lives. His actions have inspired fans and raised awareness about the importance of global child welfare initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/7Y86uBC32EE?si=b_IIcjrdrY8s_wpH">See more about Felix's trip to Laos in Youtube.</a></p>
